It can also store computer files up to 5 terabytes in size.

### What is Cloud Storage?
Cloud storage is a web service where your data can be stored, accessed, and quickly backed up by users on the internet. It is more reliable, scalable, and secure than traditional on-premises storage systems. Cloud storage is offered in two models: 
* Pay only for what you use
* Pay on a monthly basis
