# AWS S3.

## What is Amazon S3?
Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) provides object storage, which is built for storing and recovering any amount of information or data from anywhere over the internet. It provides this storage through a web services interface. While designed for developers for easier web-scale computing, it provides 99.999999999 percent durability and 99.99 percent availability of objects. It can also store computer files up to 5 terabytes in size.

### What is Cloud Storage?
Cloud storage is a web service where your data can be stored, accessed, and quickly backed up by users on the internet. It is more reliable, scalable, and secure than traditional on-premises storage systems. Cloud storage is offered in two models: 
* Pay only for what you use
* Pay on a monthly basis

Now, letâ€™s have a look at the different types of storage services offered by AWS.
