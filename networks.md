## Network types
The internet is not owned by any individual or group. The internet is a worldwide collection of interconnected networks (internetwork or internet for short), cooperating with each other to exchange information using common standards. Through telephone wires, fiber-optic cables, wireless transmissions, and satellite links, internet users can exchange information in a variety of forms.
Small home networks connect a few computers to each other and to the internet. The SOHO network allows computers in a home office or a remote office to connect to a corporate network, or access centralized, shared resources. Medium to large networks, such as those used by corporations and schools, can have many locations with hundreds or thousands of interconnected hosts. The internet is a network of networks that connects hundreds of millions of computers world-wide.
There are devices all around that you may interact with on a daily basis that are also connected to the internet. These include mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, and smart glasses. Things in your home can be connected to the internet such as a security system, appliances, your smart TV, and your gaming console. Outside your home there are smart cars, RFID tags, sensors and actuators, and even medical devices which can be connected.

## Data transmition
The following categories are used to classify types of personal data:

Volunteered data - This is created and explicitly shared by individuals, such as social network profiles. This type of data might include video files, pictures, text, or audio files.
Observed data - This is captured by recording the actions of individuals, such as location data when using cell phones.
Inferred data - This is data such as a credit score, which is based on analysis of volunteered or observed data.
The term bit is an abbreviation of “binary digit” and represents the smallest piece of data. Each bit can only have one of two possible values, 0 or 1.
There are three common methods of signal transmission used in networks:
* Electrical signals - Transmission is achieved by representing data as electrical pulses on copper wire.
* Optical signals - Transmission is achieved by converting the electrical signals into light pulses.
* Wireless signals - Transmission is achieved by using infrared, microwave, or radio waves through the air.

## Bandwidth and Throughput
Bandwidth is the capacity of a medium to carry data. Digital bandwidth measures the amount of data that can flow from one place to another in a given amount of time. Bandwidth is typically measured in the number of bits that (theoretically) can be sent across the media in a second. Common bandwidth measurements are as follows:

* Thousands of bits per second (Kbps)
* Millions of bits per second (Mbps)
* Billions of bits per second (Gbps)

Throughput does not usually match the specified bandwidth. Many factors influence throughput including:

* The amount of data being sent and received over the connection
* The latency created by the number of network devices encountered between source and destination.
  
Latency refers to the amount of time, including delays, for data to travel from one given point to another.

## ISP
An Internet Service Provider (ISP) provides the link between the home network and the internet. An ISP can be the local cable provider, a landline telephone service provider, the cellular network that provides your smartphone service, or an independent provider who leases bandwidth on the physical network infrastructure of another company.

## Clients and Servers
All computers connected to a network that participate directly in network communication are classified as hosts. Hosts can send and receive messages on the network. In modern networks, computer hosts can act as a client, a server, or both. The software installed on the computer determines which role the computer plays.

Client and server software usually run on separate computers, but it is also possible for one computer to run both client and server software at the same time. In small businesses and homes, many computers function as the servers and clients on the network. This type of network is called a P2P network. In larger businesses, because of the potential for high amounts of network traffic, it is often necessary to have dedicated servers to support the number of service requests. P2P networks are easy to set up, less complex, lower in cost, and can be used for simple tasks such as transferring files and sharing printers. However, there is no centralized administration. They have less security, are not scalable, and can perform slower.

## Network Componets
There are symbols that represent various types of networking equipment. The network infrastructure is the platform that supports the network. It provides the stable and reliable channel over which our communications can occur. The network infrastructure contains three categories of hardware components: end devices, intermediate devices, and network media. Hardware is often the visible components of the network platform such as a laptop, PC, switch, router, wireless access point, or the cabling used to connect the devices. Components that are not visible include wireless media.
End devices, or hosts, form the interface between users and the underlying communication network. Some examples of end devices include:

* Computers (workstations, laptops, file servers, web servers)
* Network printers
* Telephones and teleconferencing equipment
* Security cameras
* Mobile devices (such as smartphones, tablets, PDAs, and wireless debit/credit card readers and barcode scanners)

## ISP Connectivity Options 
An ISP provides the link between the home network and the internet. An ISP can be the local cable provider, a landline telephone service provider, the cellular network that provides your smartphone service, or an independent provider who leases bandwidth on the physical network infrastructure of another company. Each ISP connects to other ISPs to form a network of links that interconnect users all over the world. ISPs are connected in a hierarchical manner that ensures that internet traffic generally takes the shortest path from the source to the destination.

The interconnection of ISPs that forms the backbone of the internet is a complex web of fiber-optic cables with expensive networking switches and routers that direct the flow of information between source and destination hosts.

For a home user, connecting to the ISP is a fairly uncomplicated process. This is the most common connection option. It consists of using a wireless integrated router to connect to the ISP. The router includes a switch to connect wired hosts and a wireless AP to connect wireless hosts. The router also provides client IP addressing information and security for inside hosts. The two most common methods are cable and DSL. Other options include cellular, satellite, and dial-up telephone.
