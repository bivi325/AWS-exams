## Network types
The internet is not owned by any individual or group. The internet is a worldwide collection of interconnected networks (internetwork or internet for short), cooperating with each other to exchange information using common standards. Through telephone wires, fiber-optic cables, wireless transmissions, and satellite links, internet users can exchange information in a variety of forms.
Small home networks connect a few computers to each other and to the internet. The SOHO network allows computers in a home office or a remote office to connect to a corporate network, or access centralized, shared resources. Medium to large networks, such as those used by corporations and schools, can have many locations with hundreds or thousands of interconnected hosts. The internet is a network of networks that connects hundreds of millions of computers world-wide.
There are devices all around that you may interact with on a daily basis that are also connected to the internet. These include mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, and smart glasses. Things in your home can be connected to the internet such as a security system, appliances, your smart TV, and your gaming console. Outside your home there are smart cars, RFID tags, sensors and actuators, and even medical devices which can be connected.

## Data transmition
The following categories are used to classify types of personal data:

Volunteered data - This is created and explicitly shared by individuals, such as social network profiles. This type of data might include video files, pictures, text, or audio files.
Observed data - This is captured by recording the actions of individuals, such as location data when using cell phones.
Inferred data - This is data such as a credit score, which is based on analysis of volunteered or observed data.
The term bit is an abbreviation of “binary digit” and represents the smallest piece of data. Each bit can only have one of two possible values, 0 or 1.
There are three common methods of signal transmission used in networks:
* Electrical signals - Transmission is achieved by representing data as electrical pulses on copper wire.
* Optical signals - Transmission is achieved by converting the electrical signals into light pulses.
* Wireless signals - Transmission is achieved by using infrared, microwave, or radio waves through the air.

## Bandwidth and Throughput
Bandwidth is the capacity of a medium to carry data. Digital bandwidth measures the amount of data that can flow from one place to another in a given amount of time. Bandwidth is typically measured in the number of bits that (theoretically) can be sent across the media in a second. Common bandwidth measurements are as follows:

* Thousands of bits per second (Kbps)
* Millions of bits per second (Mbps)
* Billions of bits per second (Gbps)

Throughput does not usually match the specified bandwidth. Many factors influence throughput including:

* The amount of data being sent and received over the connection
* The latency created by the number of network devices encountered between source and destination.
  
Latency refers to the amount of time, including delays, for data to travel from one given point to another.

## ISP
An Internet Service Provider (ISP) provides the link between the home network and the internet. An ISP can be the local cable provider, a landline telephone service provider, the cellular network that provides your smartphone service, or an independent provider who leases bandwidth on the physical network infrastructure of another company.

## Clients and Servers
All computers connected to a network that participate directly in network communication are classified as hosts. Hosts can send and receive messages on the network. In modern networks, computer hosts can act as a client, a server, or both. The software installed on the computer determines which role the computer plays.

Client and server software usually run on separate computers, but it is also possible for one computer to run both client and server software at the same time. In small businesses and homes, many computers function as the servers and clients on the network. This type of network is called a P2P network. In larger businesses, because of the potential for high amounts of network traffic, it is often necessary to have dedicated servers to support the number of service requests. P2P networks are easy to set up, less complex, lower in cost, and can be used for simple tasks such as transferring files and sharing printers. However, there is no centralized administration. They have less security, are not scalable, and can perform slower.

## Network Componets
There are symbols that represent various types of networking equipment. The network infrastructure is the platform that supports the network. It provides the stable and reliable channel over which our communications can occur. The network infrastructure contains three categories of hardware components: end devices, intermediate devices, and network media. Hardware is often the visible components of the network platform such as a laptop, PC, switch, router, wireless access point, or the cabling used to connect the devices. Components that are not visible include wireless media.
End devices, or hosts, form the interface between users and the underlying communication network. Some examples of end devices include:

* Computers (workstations, laptops, file servers, web servers)
* Network printers
* Telephones and teleconferencing equipment
* Security cameras
* Mobile devices (such as smartphones, tablets, PDAs, and wireless debit/credit card readers and barcode scanners)

## ISP Connectivity Options 
An ISP provides the link between the home network and the internet. An ISP can be the local cable provider, a landline telephone service provider, the cellular network that provides your smartphone service, or an independent provider who leases bandwidth on the physical network infrastructure of another company. Each ISP connects to other ISPs to form a network of links that interconnect users all over the world. ISPs are connected in a hierarchical manner that ensures that internet traffic generally takes the shortest path from the source to the destination.

The interconnection of ISPs that forms the backbone of the internet is a complex web of fiber-optic cables with expensive networking switches and routers that direct the flow of information between source and destination hosts.

For a home user, connecting to the ISP is a fairly uncomplicated process. This is the most common connection option. It consists of using a wireless integrated router to connect to the ISP. The router includes a switch to connect wired hosts and a wireless AP to connect wireless hosts. The router also provides client IP addressing information and security for inside hosts. The two most common methods are cable and DSL. Other options include cellular, satellite, and dial-up telephone.


## Home Network Basics
Most home networks consist of at least two separate networks. The public network coming in from the service provider. The router is connected to the internet. Most likely, the home router is equipped with both wired and wireless capabilities. A home network is a small LAN with devices that usually connect to an integrated router and to each other in order to exchange information.

Wireless technology is fairly easy and inexpensive to install. Advantages of wireless LAN technology include mobility, scalability, flexibility, cost savings, reduced installation time, and reliability in harsh environments.

In addition to an integrated router, there are many different types of devices that might be connecting to a home network, Examples include desktop computers, gaming systems, smart tv systems, printers, scanners, security cameras, and climate control devices.

Small business and home routers typically have two primary types of ports: ethernet ports and internet ports. In addition to the wired ports, many home routers include a radio antenna and a built-in wireless access point.

## Network Technologies in the Home
Wireless technologies use electromagnetic waves to carry information between devices. The electromagnetic spectrum includes such things as radio and television broadcast bands, visible light, x-rays, and gamma-rays. Some types of electromagnetic waves are not suitable for carrying data. Other parts of the spectrum are regulated by governments and licensed to various organizations for specific applications.

Certain unlicensed sections of the spectrum are incorporated into consumer products, including the Wi-Fi routers found in most homes. The wireless technologies most frequently used in home networks are in the unlicensed 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency ranges. Bluetooth is a technology that makes use of the 2.4 GHz band. Other technologies that use the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands are the modern wireless LAN technologies that conform to the various IEEE 802.11 standards. Unlike Bluetooth technology, 802.11 devices transmit at a much higher power level giving them a great range and improved throughput.

Although many home network devices support wireless communications, there are still a few applications where devices benefit from a wired switch connection. The most commonly implemented wired protocol is the Ethernet protocol. Directly connected devices use an Ethernet patch cable, usually unshielded twisted pair. Category 5e is the most common wiring used in a LAN. The cable is made up of 4 pairs of wires that are twisted to reduce electrical interference. For those homes that do not have UTP wiring, there are other technologies, such as powerline, that can distribute wired connectivity throughout the premises.

## Wireless standards
The IEEE 802.11 standard governs the WLAN environment. Wireless standards for LANs use the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands. Collectively these technologies are referred to as Wi-Fi. The Wi-Fi Alliance is responsible for testing wireless LAN devices from different manufacturers.

Wireless routers using the 802.11 standards have multiple settings that have to be configured. These settings include the following:

Network mode - Determines the type of technology that must be supported. For example, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n or Mixed Mode.
Network Name (SSID) - Used to identify the WLAN. All devices that wish to participate in the WLAN must have the same SSID.
Standard Channel - Specifies the channel over which communication will occur. By default, this is set to Auto to allow the access point (AP) to determine the optimum channel to use.
SSID Broadcast - Determines if the SSID will be broadcast to all devices within range. By default, set to Enabled.
The 802.11 protocol can provide increased throughput based on the wireless network environment. If all wireless devices connect with the same 802.11 standard, maximum speeds can be obtained for that standard. If the access point is configured to accept only one 802.11 standard, devices that do not use that standard cannot connect to the access point. A mixed mode wireless network environment can include devices that use any of the existing Wi-Fi standards.

When building a wireless network, it is important that the wireless components connect to the appropriate WLAN. This is done using the SSID. The SSID is used to tell wireless devices, called STAs, which WLAN they belong to and with which other devices they can communicate. The SSID broadcast allows other devices and wireless clients to automatically discover the name of the wireless network. When the SSID broadcast is disabled, you must manually enter the SSID on wireless devices.

## Communication Protocol

Protocols are required for computers to properly communicate across the network. These include message format, message size, timing, encoding, encapsulation, and message patterns.

* Message format - When a message is sent, it must use a specific format or structure.
* Message size - The rules that govern the size of the pieces communicated across the network are very strict. They can also be different, depending on the channel used.
* Timing - Timing determines the speed at which the bits are transmitted across the network. It also affects when an individual host can send data and the total amount of data that can be sent in any one transmission.
* Encoding - Messages sent across the network are first converted into bits by the sending host. Each bit is encoded into a pattern of sounds, light waves, or electrical impulses depending on the network media over which the bits are transmitted.
* Encapsulation - Each message transmitted on a network must include a header that contains addressing information that identifies the source and destination hosts. Encapsulation is the process of adding this information to the pieces of data that make up the message.
* Message pattern - Some messages require an acknowledgment before the next message can be sent. This type of request/response pattern is a common aspect of many networking protocols. However, there are other types of messages that may be simply streamed across the network, without concern as to whether they reach their destination.

## Communication standards
Topologies allow us to see the networking using representation of end devices and intermediary devices. How does a device see a network? Think of a device in a bubble. The only thing a device sees is its own addressing information. How does the device know it is on the same network as another device? The answer is network protocols. Most network communications are broken up into smaller data units, or packets.

A standard is a set of rules that determines how something must be done. Networking and internet standards ensure that all devices connecting to the network implement the same set of rules or protocols in the same manner. Using standards, it is possible for different types of devices to send information to each other over the internet.

An internet standard is the end result of a comprehensive cycle of discussion, problem solving, and testing. These different standards are developed, published, and maintained by a variety of organizations. When a new standard is proposed, each stage of the development and approval process is recorded in a numbered RFC document so that the evolution of the standard is tracked. RFCs for internet standards are published and managed by the IETF.

## Network comminication models
Protocols are the rules that govern communications. Successful communication between hosts requires interaction between a number of protocols. Protocols include HTTP, TCP, IP, and Ethernet. These protocols are implemented in software and hardware that are installed on each host and networking device.

The interaction between the different protocols on a device can be illustrated as a protocol stack. A stack illustrates the protocols as a layered hierarchy, with each higher-level protocol depending on the services of the protocols shown in the lower levels. The separation of functions enables each layer in the stack to operate independently of others.

The suite of TCP/IP protocols that are used for internet communications follows the structure of this model:

* Application - Represents data to the user, plus encoding and dialog control
* Transport -Supports communication between various devices across diverse networks
* Internet - Determines the best path through the network
* Network Access - The hardware devices and media that make up the network.

A reference model describes the functions that must be completed at a particular layer but does not specify exactly how a function should be accomplished. The primary purpose of a reference model is to aid in clearer understanding of the functions and processes necessary for network communications.

The most widely known internetwork reference model was created by the OSI project at the International ISO. It is used for data network design, operation specifications, and troubleshooting. This model is commonly referred to as the OSI model.


## OSI model layer description
7 – Application - The application layer contains protocols used for process-to-process communications.
6 – Presentation - The presentation layer provides for common representation of the data transferred between application layer services.
5 – Session - The session layer provides services to the presentation layer to organize its dialogue and to manage data exchange.
4 – Transport - The transport layer defines services to segment, transfer, and reassemble the data for individual communications between the end devices.
3 – Network - The network layer provides services to exchange the individual pieces of data over the network between identified end devices.
2 - Data Link - The data link layer protocols describe methods for exchanging data frames between devices over a common media
1 – Physical - The physical layer protocols describe the mechanical, electrical, functional, and procedural means to activate, maintain, and de-activate physical connections for a bit transmission to and from a network device.


## Encapsulation and the Ethernet Frame
The process of placing one message format inside another message format is called encapsulation. De-encapsulation occurs when the process is reversed by the recipient and the letter is removed from the envelope. Just as a letter is encapsulated in an envelope for delivery, so computer messages are encapsulated. A message that is sent over a computer network follows specific format rules for it to be delivered and processed.

The Ethernet protocol standards define many aspects of network communication including frame format, frame size, timing, and encoding. The format for Ethernet frames specifies the location of the destination and source MAC addresses, and additional information including preamble for sequencing and timing, start of frame delimiter, length and type of frame, and frame check sequence to detect transmission errors.

## The access layer
The access layer is the part of the network in which people gain access to other hosts and to shared files and printers. The access layer provides the first line of networking devices that connect hosts to the wired Ethernet network. Within an Ethernet network, each host can connect directly to an access layer networking device using an Ethernet cable. Ethernet hubs contain multiple ports that are used to connect hosts to the network. Only one message can be sent through an Ethernet hub at a time. Two or more messages sent at the same time will cause a collision. Because excessive retransmissions can clog up the network and slow down network traffic, hubs are now considered obsolete and have been replaced by Ethernet switches.

An Ethernet switch is a device that is used at Layer 2. When a host sends a message to another host connected to the same switched network, the switch accepts and decodes the frames to read the MAC address portion of the message. A table on the switch, called a MAC address table, contains a list of all the active ports and the host MAC addresses that are attached to them. When a message is sent between hosts, the switch checks to see if the destination MAC address is in the table. If it is, the switch builds a temporary connection, called a circuit, between the source and destination ports. Ethernet switches also allow for sending and receiving frames over the same Ethernet cable simultaneously. This improves the performance of the network by eliminating collisions.

A switch builds the MAC address table by examining the source MAC address of each frame that is sent between hosts. When a new host sends a message or responds to a flooded message, the switch immediately learns its MAC address and the port to which it is connected. The table is dynamically updated each time a new source MAC address is read by the switch.
